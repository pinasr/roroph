# roroph: Roll-on/Roll-Off (RoRo) Connectivity and Transport Data

## Overview
The `roroph` package provides a standardized, machine-readable geospatial dataset of the 108 primary and missionary routes comprising the Philippine Nautical Highway System. It is designed to serve as 2025–2026 Structural Baseline for spatial data science, regional science, and transport logistics analysis.

Unlike traditional distance-based spatial models, `roroph` treats the Philippine archipelago as a living network. It provides the necessary edge-list and node-attribute data to move beyond simple Euclidean distance ($d$) and into Frictional Connectivity, accounting for:

**Node Adjacency:** Directed links between 45 coastal provinces.

**Temporal Friction:** Average travel time in hours ($T$) across the sea-gap.

**Flow Capacity:** Daily frequency ($f$), passenger capacity, and cargo volume.

## Installation
For the development version:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("njtalingting/roroph")

## Applications
This package is built to integrate seamlessly with ArchipelagoEngine. Use roroph to construct custom **Spatial Weight Matrices ($W$)** based on maritime frequency rather than just 
contiguity.

library(roroph)
data("roro_routes")

# Filter for the Western Nautical Highway (WNH)
wnh_network <- roro_routes[roro_routes$highway_type == "Western", ]

# Use these links to build a directed spatial graph
# (Integration hooks for ArchipelagoEngine 0.1.2)
````

## Data Source
All topological links and attributes are harmonized from 2025-2026 maritime transparency reports from the Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and Philippine 
Ports Authority (PPA). The dataset is structured to support analyses in regional development studies.
